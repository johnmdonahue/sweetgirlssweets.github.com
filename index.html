                </div>
                
                <p>
                  Sweet Girls' Sweets is my home-based business here in Lexington,
                  KY started after many years of encouragement from family and
                  friends. All desserts are prepared after the order is placed - not
                  ahead of time - and most fruits are hand-picked or purchased from
                  local Kentucky growers. All crusts are made from scratch and
                  rolled by hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Freshness is our top priority!
                </p>
                
                <h2>The Name</h2>
                <p>
                  The name's meaning is really two-fold. Most simply, I chose the
                  name because sweet girls (and even not-so-sweet girls) love to
                  eat sweets. Obvious enough, huh? Actually, the name has a very
                  personal meaning. The girls in my family have been baking together
                  and using these recipes for many generations. I was raised (and
                  still enjoy) baking with my mother and grandmother. I now have two
                  girls of my own and have the joy of teaching them how to bake. When
                  naming my business, I thought of my past and looked to my future
                  &hellip; when my girls will be preparing Sweet Girls' Sweets.
                </p>

                <h2>30 Years of Experience</h2>
                <p>
                  I have been baking since before I can remember. My mother had me
                  at her side in the kitchen from the time I was tall enough to
                  reach the counter and stovetop while standing in a chair! I made
                  my first pie when I was 3. It was a lime meringue and I remember
                  it fondly. With my mother's guidance, I made the pie from crust to
                  filling to meringue! I've been baking ever since!
